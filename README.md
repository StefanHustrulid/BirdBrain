# BirdBrain

Neural Network Project Initiated for the CSM Robotics Club Exoskeleton Team's WreckItRalph Project

Matlab code can support Artificial Neural Network with fully connected layers and various adjustable parameters

Python code can support any combination in layers involved in a Convolution Neural Network

The Convolution type layers are designed for N sets of 2D arrays with c channels. Ex: multiple RGB Images at a time



# TODO

No further improvements are planned for the Matlab code

Debugg the python code to ensure the program is fully functioning

Incoprerate different methods of gradient descent such as Momentum and Nesterov accelerated gradient

Incorperate S-shaped ReLU activation functions

Add Recurrent Layers to add RNN functionality

Add Evolution Training Method

Create a new version that uses the GPU to do calculations much faster
